# Comprehensive Analysis of Pakistan's Health Data Using Pivot Tables
# Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive health dataset from various hospitals across Pakistan. The dataset consists of detailed patient visit records, including demographic information, disease prevalence, treatment costs, insurance coverage, and hospital performance. The goal is to generate insights to improve healthcare services and outcomes in Pakistan.

# Dataset Description

Rows: 2000 patient records
Columns: 15 attributes including:
Hospital Name,
Patient Name,
Age,
Gender,
Admission & Discharge Dates,
Disease Treated,
Treatment Cost (PKR),
Insurance Coverage Status,
Blood Group,
Height (cm),
Weight (kg),
Contact Number,
Patientâ€™s City and Province of Residence

# Objectives of the Project

The key objectives of this analysis are to:
Understand patient demographics: Analyze the distribution of age, gender, height, and weight.
Identify common diseases and their geographical distribution across cities and provinces.
Assess treatment costs and financial burdens, especially the impact of insurance.
Compare hospital performance based on patient volume, costs, and other metrics.
Analyze peak admission and discharge times.
Study the distribution of blood groups among patients.
Enable data-driven decisions for improving healthcare.

# Tools and Software Used

Microsoft Excel: To analyze data using Pivot Tables and generate visualizations.
Pivot Tables: Used for summarizing large amounts of data and uncovering patterns.
Charts: Created to visually represent key insights from the data.

# Steps in the Analysis

# Data Preparation: 

Import the dataset into Excel and review the fields to ensure proper formatting (dates, numeric values, etc.).

# Creating Pivot Tables:

Patient Demographics: Pivot tables to analyze the distribution of age, gender, height, and weight.
Disease Prevalence: Create a pivot table showing the number of cases per disease by city and province.
Cost Analysis: Summarize average treatment costs across hospitals and analyze the financial impact of insurance.
Hospital Performance: Compare patient volume and average treatment costs by hospital.

# Generating Charts:

Bar Charts for disease distribution across provinces.
Pie Charts for gender distribution across different hospitals.
Line Charts to display hospital admission and discharge trends by month.
Scatter Plots for analyzing the correlation between age and treatment costs.

# Insights:

Peak Admission/Discharge Times: Admissions peak in January, while discharges peak in August.
Treatment Costs: The highest treatment costs are observed in Mayo Hospital, while Civil Hospital Karachi has the lowest.
Disease Prevalence: The most commonly treated disease is cancer.
Insurance Impact: Insurance coverage helps reduce out-of-pocket costs, but treatment costs vary significantly across hospitals.
Conclusion: The analysis provides actionable insights for policymakers and healthcare providers to improve resource allocation, disease management, and financial planning.

# Instructions to Run the Analysis

View the Charts: The Excel file contains pre-generated charts in different tabs. These visualizations will help you understand key findings such as patient demographics, cost analysis, and disease distribution.

Generate Your Own Pivot Tables: To recreate the pivot tables:

# Select the dataset.

Go to the Insert menu in Excel.
Choose Pivot Table, select the desired fields (e.g., Age, Hospital, Disease, Cost), and arrange them in rows/columns as needed.
Modifying Charts: You can adjust the existing charts or create new ones by selecting relevant data from the pivot tables and using the Insert Chart feature in Excel.
